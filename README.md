# sys 🛠️ 

**The ultimate single-word power utility for macOS.**

`sys` is a lightweight, high-performance Bash utility designed to replace dozens of complex terminal commands with a single, intuitive interface. Instead of remembering obscure flags for `system_profiler`, `networkquality`, or `pmset`, you just type `sys`.



## 🚀 One-Line Installation

Open your terminal and paste the following command. This will download the script, move it to your local binaries, and make it executable:

```bash
sudo curl -sSL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamestheakston1/sys/main/sys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamestheakston1/sys/main/sys) -o /usr/local/bin/sys && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sys && echo "\033[1;32m✅ sys installed successfully! Type 'sys help' to get started.\033[0m"
